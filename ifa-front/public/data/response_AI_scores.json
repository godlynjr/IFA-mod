Regular check-ups can monitor heart health as you age.\n- Active energy score: Keep up the good work! To prevent plateaus and continue improving, consider increasing the intensity or duration of exercises.\n- SpO2 score: With optimal oxygen saturation levels, there is no immediate concern for lung function. However, regular monitoring and maintaining a healthy lifestyle are essential for preserving lung health.\n\nPlease note that the scores and recommendations are hypothetical and based on the provided data.
